**Project Title: Classification Model Comparison**

**Description:**

The purpose of this project is to implement and compare the performance of three classification models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree. We aim to predict individuals' income based on their features using a dataset located in the "Data" folder.

**Dataset:**

- Dataset Name: Adult_TrainDataset
- Samples: 32,561
- Features: Features describing individuals' characteristics
- Labels: "Income" column representing two classes

**Implementation:**

- Utilize pre-built models from the scikit-learn library for implementation.
- Visualize training datasets using at least two graphical models to gain insights into data distribution and relationships.
- Handle missing values (Null) in the dataset by replacing them with appropriate values or deleting corresponding columns.

**Model Evaluation:**

- After training the models, evaluate their performance using the "Adult_TestDataset" dataset.
- Utilize confusion matrix and evaluation metrics such as recall, precision, accuracy, and F1-score to analyze the obtained results.
- Leverage scikit-learn's ready-made functions to obtain the confusion matrix and evaluation metrics.

**Note:**

- This project serves as an exploration of classification model performance and dataset analysis techniques.
- Detailed documentation of implementation steps, model performance, and analysis findings will be provided in the project report.
